## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18 and **npm** ≥ 9
- **EAS CLI** (for APK/AAB builds): `npm install -g eas-cli`

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epavankalyan/voltlink-mobile.git
cd voltlink-mobile
make install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set at minimum:

```env
# Required — point to your backend (local or remote)
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1
```

> **Note:** The app will throw an error at startup if `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not set.

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
make start
```

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables

All variables are prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` and defined in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`).

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` | ✅ Yes | — | Full backend API base URL (e.g. `https://api.voltlink.io/api/v1`) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT` | No | `10000` | Request timeout in milliseconds |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_VEHICLE_ID` | No | `VH001` | Fallback vehicle ID before auth resolves |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_FLEET_ID` | No | `1` | Fallback fleet ID for fleet-level calls |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_USER_ID` | No | `11` | Fallback B2C user ID before auth resolves |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_LAT` | No | `12.9716` | Default map latitude (Bangalore) |

## 📦 Building APKs

Run `make help` to see all available targets. Key build commands:

```bash
# 1. Log in to your Expo / EAS account (one-time)
make eas-login

# 2. Configure EAS for this project (one-time, creates eas.json)
make eas-configure

# 3a. Preview APK — signed, distributable (great for testers)
make build-apk-preview

# 3b. Production APK — store-ready, signed
make build-apk-production

# 3c. Production AAB — for Google Play Store submission
make build-aab-production
```

EAS builds run in the cloud. Download the output from the [EAS dashboard](https://expo.dev/) once the build completes.

### Build Profiles (`eas.json`)

| Profile | Format | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `development` | APK | Internal dev builds with dev client |
| `preview` | APK | QA / tester distribution |
| `production` | AAB | Google Play Store submission |

## 📱 How to Test the Application

### Method A: Mobile (Expo Go)
1. Install **Expo Go** on your phone ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)).
2. Run `make start` and scan the QR code.
3. Ensure your phone and machine are on the **same Wi-Fi**, or use `npx expo start --tunnel` if on different networks.

### Method B: Web Browser
1. Run `make web` and open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
2. Use the [Web Mobile First](https://www.webmobilefirst.com/en/) extension for device-frame emulation.
3. **Note:** The interactive map uses a placeholder on web; all other features work fully.
